# LoLDodgeGame

---
 Our final 30 idea is a training mode for the popular game ***league of legends***. Dodging is a fundamentally important aspect of the game so using projectiles that spawn at random intervals we will have the player attempt to dodge around them for an extended period of time while gaining points. Once the player is hit by a projectile, they lose. There will be 3 modes; easy, medium, and hard. This will allow the player to practice the dodging aspect of the game without needing to play the game.

 This will be coded in python, a coding language we have never used before. We will have to find sources to help such as videos or websites. 

## Projectiles
> Not every projectile is the same and they all act differently from each other. Some are better than others such as a bigger or faster projectile. During the game, the projectiles will be randomly chosen and the player will have to react accordingly depending on the projectile coming at them. Depending on the difficulty, more projectiles will be added as well as more difficult projectiles. 

## Champions
> In league of legends, there are playable characters called ***champions***. These champions have their own unique abilities that can help them defeat other enemies but can also help them in dodging abilities. Some of these abilities can be dashes, movement speed buffs, and others such as untargetability (cannot be hit). Abilities all have unique cooldowns. This means once an ability is used, there is a set amount of time you will have to wait before you can use it again. The player will have to think carefully when they should use an ability as it could possibly cost them their score.

# Milestones

---
These are goals spread out throughout the week that we hopefully reach during our time working on it for the game to function. Although we have an idea of what we want, coding in python is completely new to us so it will take some time to learn in our limited time we have to finish this. These goals are set to push us to learn python in a set amount of time while using previous knowledge learnt in this class. Although we may not finish, as long as the game can be played and people are able to tell what the purpose of the game is, that is the real final goal that we want to achieve for people that are playing our game.

## Week 1
> - Create the playing field ✔
> - Create the champion hitbox ✔
> - Create movement ✔
> - Create projectiles ✔

## Week 2
> - Timer ✔
> - Projectile Movement/Indicators ✔
> - Start Screen ✔
> - Graphics
> - Difficulties
> - Abilities

# Future Plans

---
Because we used a coding language we have never used, this project took longer than it had to be if we used a coding language that we know. This was the purpose of the final 30 idea and branching out is a good experience for the future. Future plans to improve upon our game is to first of all, finish it. There are features that are still not incorperated into the game which would really expand the game from where we are now. Then we should 

## Mistakes
> During our proccess of creating our game, we made several errors that took a lot of searching for to fix. We were able to overcome these by asking friends that know python better than us while still learning more about what can be done in python. An example would be in the first week when we were not aware of a function that automatically detects collision with objects. The game did run but it is exremly inefficient with many redundant lines of code.
